# Workshop-5

This project is a single-page layout that focuses on building a more detailed card component with buttons and custom styling using plain HTML and CSS.

> Repository: https://github.com/Burdulaa/Workshop-5

## Overview

The goal of this workshop is to practice:

- Designing a centered card component
- Styling buttons and hover states
- Working with images inside a card layout
- Separating structure (HTML) from presentation (CSS)

The page is fully static and runs entirely in the browser.

## Features

- Single-page static website (`index.html`)
- Card component with:
  - Title, descriptive text and additional details
  - One or more call-to-action buttons
- Custom styling in a separate stylesheet (`style.css`)
- Local image assets stored in the `Images/` folder (e.g., used as card image or icons)
- Pure front-end: HTML + CSS only, no JavaScript, no backend

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Getting Started

You only need a web browser.
